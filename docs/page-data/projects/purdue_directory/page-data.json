Made with [Flutter](http://flutter.io). The app was at one point on the Play Store, but I delisted it and am waiting for the last active install to stop using it to delete it entirely, as Google is aggresive to casual app developers\n\n## This Project\n\nThis project was a small experiment to (a) using Flutter and (b) publishing an app to the Play Store. It was a success in that it was fascinatingly easy. In the end, because of how Google reserves the right to close entire Google accounts associated with apps that aren't updated to use the latest APIs (instead of delisting the app), I don't think I'll do it again, but I don't regret doing it.\n\n## TODO\n\nSupport PGP/GPG keys (which requires an extra HTTP request since it displays in a popup)\n"}}}}}
