This extension is very early in development and currently only supports \nJavascript with Jest.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMy motivation for making this stems from a couple places. All of them at my summer camp.\n\nForemost, VS Code has had an undeniable surge in popularity, with Microsoft taking it from some random code editor to the single most popular IDE in the\nentire industry in around a year. It should be noted, it is not without merit. I use Jetbrains products, as does everyone else at my camp. They make great products,\nand their support for Java is unmatched still. However, with plugins, VS Code comes _darn close_ in other languages like Javascript, especially since Microsoft develops\nTypeScript. As a result, it's compelling to teach campers to code using VS Code since it's what most people use, and it's free. However, as mentioned previously, there is no\nextension that is close to Jetbrain's edu platform.\n\nSecondly, I want to challenge myself to make a better personal curriculum. One of the main tenants of our camp is the ability of our counselors to personalize curriculum to\nindividual campers, and that will always be true. However, most campers happen to fall into some main categories and get taught the same things. Therefore, it is useful to\nhave a set of lessons and challenges to at least start from. They can always be personalized and changed, but starting from scratch every summer is a little exhausting.\n\n## Building\n\nTo build yourself, you must have a Font Awesome Pro license. To generate\nall of the icon files, run the `generate-icons` npm task.\n\nAfter you do that, you can open the extension in VS Code and press F5 to\ndebug as normal.\n"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1069205436","63159454"]}
